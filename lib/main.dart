//StatefulWidget can have a State and the data can change external and internal (internal state). Rerenders  when input data or local state changes
//Therefore we need two clases, one for the State(ful) and one for the rest.
//To let know the State belongs to MyApp widget we need to do two things:
//1. State<MyApp>
//2. State<StatefulWidget> createState()
